#  TAG: quick_abort_min	(KB)
#Default:
# quick_abort_min 16 KB

#  TAG: quick_abort_max	(KB)
#Default:
# quick_abort_max 16 KB

#  TAG: quick_abort_pct	(percent)
#	The cache by default continues downloading aborted requests
#	which are almost completed (less than 16 KB remaining). This
#	may be undesirable on slow (e.g. SLIP) links and/or very busy
#	caches.  Impatient users may tie up file descriptors and
#	bandwidth by repeatedly requesting and immediately aborting
#	downloads.
#
#	When the user aborts a request, Squid will check the
#	quick_abort values to the amount of data transferred until
#	then.
#
#	If the transfer has less than 'quick_abort_min' KB remaining,
#	it will finish the retrieval.
#
#	If the transfer has more than 'quick_abort_max' KB remaining,
#	it will abort the retrieval.
#
#	If more than 'quick_abort_pct' of the transfer has completed,
#	it will finish the retrieval.
#
#	If you do not want any retrieval to continue after the client
#	has aborted, set both 'quick_abort_min' and 'quick_abort_max'
#	to '0 KB'.
#
#	If you want retrievals to always continue if they are being
#	cached set 'quick_abort_min' to '-1 KB'.
#Default:
# quick_abort_pct 95

#  TAG: read_ahead_gap	buffer-size
#	The amount of data the cache will buffer ahead of what has been
#	sent to the client when retrieving an object from another server.
#Default:
# read_ahead_gap 16 KB

#  TAG: negative_ttl	time-units
#	Set the Default Time-to-Live (TTL) for failed requests.
#	Certain types of failures (such as "connection refused" and
#	"404 Not Found") are able to be negatively-cached for a short time.
#	Modern web servers should provide Expires: header, however if they
#	do not this can provide a minimum TTL.
#	The default is not to cache errors with unknown expiry details.
#
#	Note that this is different from negative caching of DNS lookups.
#
#	WARNING: Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling
#	this feature could make you liable for problems which it
#	causes.
#Default:
# negative_ttl 0 seconds

#  TAG: positive_dns_ttl	time-units
#	Upper limit on how long Squid will cache positive DNS responses.
#	Default is 6 hours (360 minutes). This directive must be set
#	larger than negative_dns_ttl.
#Default:
# positive_dns_ttl 6 hours

#  TAG: negative_dns_ttl	time-units
#	Time-to-Live (TTL) for negative caching of failed DNS lookups.
#	This also sets the lower cache limit on positive lookups.
#	Minimum value is 1 second, and it is not recommendable to go
#	much below 10 seconds.
#Default:
# negative_dns_ttl 1 minutes

#  TAG: range_offset_limit	size [acl acl...]
#	usage: (size) [units] [[!]aclname]
#	
#	Sets an upper limit on how far (number of bytes) into the file 
#	a Range request	may be to cause Squid to prefetch the whole file. 
#	If beyond this limit, Squid forwards the Range request as it is and 
#	the result is NOT cached.
#	
#	This is to stop a far ahead range request (lets say start at 17MB)
#	from making Squid fetch the whole object up to that point before
#	sending anything to the client.
#	
#	Multiple range_offset_limit lines may be specified, and they will 
#	be searched from top to bottom on each request until a match is found. 
#	The first match found will be used.  If no line matches a request, the 
#	default limit of 0 bytes will be used.
#	
#	'size' is the limit specified as a number of units.
#	
#	'units' specifies whether to use bytes, KB, MB, etc.
#	If no units are specified bytes are assumed.
#	
#	A size of 0 causes Squid to never fetch more than the
#	client requested. (default)
#	
#	A size of 'none' causes Squid to always fetch the object from the
#	beginning so it may cache the result. (2.0 style)
#	
#	'aclname' is the name of a defined ACL.
#	
#	NP: Using 'none' as the byte value here will override any quick_abort settings 
#	    that may otherwise apply to the range request. The range request will
#	    be fully fetched from start to finish regardless of the client
#	    actions. This affects bandwidth usage.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: minimum_expiry_time	(seconds)
#	The minimum caching time according to (Expires - Date)
#	headers Squid honors if the object can't be revalidated.
#	The default is 60 seconds.
#
#	In reverse proxy environments it might be desirable to honor
#	shorter object lifetimes. It is most likely better to make
#	your server return a meaningful Last-Modified header however.
#
#	In ESI environments where page fragments often have short
#	lifetimes, this will often be best set to 0.
#Default:
# minimum_expiry_time 60 seconds

#  TAG: store_avg_object_size	(bytes)
#	Average object size, used to estimate number of objects your
#	cache can hold.  The default is 13 KB.
#
#	This is used to pre-seed the cache index memory allocation to
#	reduce expensive reallocate operations while handling clients
#	traffic. Too-large values may result in memory allocation during
#	peak traffic, too-small values will result in wasted memory.
#
#	Check the cache manager 'info' report metrics for the real
#	object sizes seen by your Squid before tuning this.
#Default:
# store_avg_object_size 13 KB

#  TAG: store_objects_per_bucket
#	Target number of objects per bucket in the store hash table.
#	Lowering this value increases the total number of buckets and
#	also the storage maintenance rate.  The default is 20.
#Default:
# store_objects_per_bucket 20

# HTTP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: request_header_max_size	(KB)
#	This specifies the maximum size for HTTP headers in a request.
#	Request headers are usually relatively small (about 512 bytes).
#	Placing a limit on the request header size will catch certain
#	bugs (for example with persistent connections) and possibly
#	buffer-overflow or denial-of-service attacks.
#Default:
# request_header_max_size 64 KB

#  TAG: reply_header_max_size	(KB)
#	This specifies the maximum size for HTTP headers in a reply.
#	Reply headers are usually relatively small (about 512 bytes).
#	Placing a limit on the reply header size will catch certain
#	bugs (for example with persistent connections) and possibly
#	buffer-overflow or denial-of-service attacks.
#Default:
# reply_header_max_size 64 KB

#  TAG: request_body_max_size	(bytes)
#	This specifies the maximum size for an HTTP request body.
#	In other words, the maximum size of a PUT/POST request.
#	A user who attempts to send a request with a body larger
#	than this limit receives an "Invalid Request" error message.
#	If you set this parameter to a zero (the default), there will
#	be no limit imposed.
#
#	See also client_request_buffer_max_size for an alternative
#	limitation on client uploads which can be configured.
#Default:
# No limit.

#  TAG: client_request_buffer_max_size	(bytes)
#	This specifies the maximum buffer size of a client request.
#	It prevents squid eating too much memory when somebody uploads
#	a large file.
#Default:
# client_request_buffer_max_size 512 KB

#  TAG: chunked_request_body_max_size	(bytes)
#	A broken or confused HTTP/1.1 client may send a chunked HTTP
#	request to Squid. Squid does not have full support for that
#	feature yet. To cope with such requests, Squid buffers the
#	entire request and then dechunks request body to create a
#	plain HTTP/1.0 request with a known content length. The plain
#	request is then used by the rest of Squid code as usual.
#
#	The option value specifies the maximum size of the buffer used
#	to hold the request before the conversion. If the chunked
#	request size exceeds the specified limit, the conversion
#	fails, and the client receives an "unsupported request" error,
#	as if dechunking was disabled.
#
#	Dechunking is enabled by default. To disable conversion of
#	chunked requests, set the maximum to zero.
#
#	Request dechunking feature and this option in particular are a
#	temporary hack. When chunking requests and responses are fully
#	supported, there will be no need to buffer a chunked request.
#Default:
# chunked_request_body_max_size 64 KB

#  TAG: broken_posts
#	A list of ACL elements which, if matched, causes Squid to send
#	an extra CRLF pair after the body of a PUT/POST request.
#
#	Some HTTP servers has broken implementations of PUT/POST,
#	and rely on an extra CRLF pair sent by some WWW clients.
#
#	Quote from RFC2616 section 4.1 on this matter:
#
#	  Note: certain buggy HTTP/1.0 client implementations generate an
#	  extra CRLF's after a POST request. To restate what is explicitly
#	  forbidden by the BNF, an HTTP/1.1 client must not preface or follow
#	  a request with an extra CRLF.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#Example:
# acl buggy_server url_regex ^http://....
# broken_posts allow buggy_server
#Default:
# Obey RFC 2616.

#  TAG: adaptation_uses_indirect_client	on|off
#	Controls whether the indirect client IP address (instead of the direct
#	client IP address) is passed to adaptation services.
#
#	See also: follow_x_forwarded_for adaptation_send_client_ip
#Default:
# adaptation_uses_indirect_client on

#  TAG: via	on|off
#	If set (default), Squid will include a Via header in requests and
#	replies as required by RFC2616.
#Default:
# via on

#  TAG: ie_refresh	on|off
#	Microsoft Internet Explorer up until version 5.5 Service
#	Pack 1 has an issue with transparent proxies, wherein it
#	is impossible to force a refresh.  Turning this on provides
#	a partial fix to the problem, by causing all IMS-REFRESH
#	requests from older IE versions to check the origin server
#	for fresh content.  This reduces hit ratio by some amount
#	(~10% in my experience), but allows users to actually get
#	fresh content when they want it.  Note because Squid
#	cannot tell if the user is using 5.5 or 5.5SP1, the behavior
#	of 5.5 is unchanged from old versions of Squid (i.e. a
#	forced refresh is impossible).  Newer versions of IE will,
#	hopefully, continue to have the new behavior and will be
#	handled based on that assumption.  This option defaults to
#	the old Squid behavior, which is better for hit ratios but
#	worse for clients using IE, if they need to be able to
#	force fresh content.
#Default:
# ie_refresh off

#  TAG: vary_ignore_expire	on|off
#	Many HTTP servers supporting Vary gives such objects
#	immediate expiry time with no cache-control header
#	when requested by a HTTP/1.0 client. This option
#	enables Squid to ignore such expiry times until
#	HTTP/1.1 is fully implemented.
#
#	WARNING: If turned on this may eventually cause some
#	varying objects not intended for caching to get cached.
#Default:
# vary_ignore_expire off

#  TAG: request_entities
#	Squid defaults to deny GET and HEAD requests with request entities,
#	as the meaning of such requests are undefined in the HTTP standard
#	even if not explicitly forbidden.
#
#	Set this directive to on if you have clients which insists
#	on sending request entities in GET or HEAD requests. But be warned
#	that there is server software (both proxies and web servers) which
#	can fail to properly process this kind of request which may make you
#	vulnerable to cache pollution attacks if enabled.
#Default:
# request_entities off

#  TAG: request_header_access
#	Usage: request_header_access header_name allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	WARNING: Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling
#	this feature could make you liable for problems which it
#	causes.
#
#	This option replaces the old 'anonymize_headers' and the
#	older 'http_anonymizer' option with something that is much
#	more configurable. A list of ACLs for each header name allows
#	removal of specific header fields under specific conditions.
#
#	This option only applies to outgoing HTTP request headers (i.e.,
#	headers sent by Squid to the next HTTP hop such as a cache peer
#	or an origin server). The option has no effect during cache hit
#	detection. The equivalent adaptation vectoring point in ICAP
#	terminology is post-cache REQMOD.
#
#	The option is applied to individual outgoing request header
#	fields. For each request header field F, Squid uses the first
#	qualifying sets of request_header_access rules:
#
#	    1. Rules with header_name equal to F's name.
#	    2. Rules with header_name 'Other', provided F's name is not
#	       on the hard-coded list of commonly used HTTP header names.
#	    3. Rules with header_name 'All'.
#
#	Within that qualifying rule set, rule ACLs are checked as usual.
#	If ACLs of an "allow" rule match, the header field is allowed to
#	go through as is. If ACLs of a "deny" rule match, the header is
#	removed and request_header_replace is then checked to identify
#	if the removed header has a replacement. If no rules within the
#	set have matching ACLs, the header field is left as is.
#
#	For example, to achieve the same behavior as the old
#	'http_anonymizer standard' option, you should use:
#
#		request_header_access From deny all
#		request_header_access Referer deny all
#		request_header_access User-Agent deny all
#
#	Or, to reproduce the old 'http_anonymizer paranoid' feature
#	you should use:
#
#		request_header_access Authorization allow all
#		request_header_access Proxy-Authorization allow all
#		request_header_access Cache-Control allow all
#		request_header_access Content-Length allow all
#		request_header_access Content-Type allow all
#		request_header_access Date allow all
#		request_header_access Host allow all
#		request_header_access If-Modified-Since allow all
#		request_header_access Pragma allow all
#		request_header_access Accept allow all
#		request_header_access Accept-Charset allow all
#		request_header_access Accept-Encoding allow all
#		request_header_access Accept-Language allow all
#		request_header_access Connection allow all
#		request_header_access All deny all
#
#	HTTP reply headers are controlled with the reply_header_access directive.
#
#	By default, all headers are allowed (no anonymizing is performed).
#Default:
# No limits.

#  TAG: reply_header_access
#	Usage: reply_header_access header_name allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	WARNING: Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling
#	this feature could make you liable for problems which it
#	causes.
#
#	This option only applies to reply headers, i.e., from the
#	server to the client.
#
#	This is the same as request_header_access, but in the other
#	direction. Please see request_header_access for detailed
#	documentation.
#
#	For example, to achieve the same behavior as the old
#	'http_anonymizer standard' option, you should use:
#
#		reply_header_access Server deny all
#		reply_header_access WWW-Authenticate deny all
#		reply_header_access Link deny all
#
#	Or, to reproduce the old 'http_anonymizer paranoid' feature
#	you should use:
#
#		reply_header_access Allow allow all
#		reply_header_access WWW-Authenticate allow all
#		reply_header_access Proxy-Authenticate allow all
#		reply_header_access Cache-Control allow all
#		reply_header_access Content-Encoding allow all
#		reply_header_access Content-Length allow all
#		reply_header_access Content-Type allow all
#		reply_header_access Date allow all
#		reply_header_access Expires allow all
#		reply_header_access Last-Modified allow all
#		reply_header_access Location allow all
#		reply_header_access Pragma allow all
#		reply_header_access Content-Language allow all
#		reply_header_access Retry-After allow all
#		reply_header_access Title allow all
#		reply_header_access Content-Disposition allow all
#		reply_header_access Connection allow all
#		reply_header_access All deny all
#
#	HTTP request headers are controlled with the request_header_access directive.
#
#	By default, all headers are allowed (no anonymizing is
#	performed).
#Default:
# No limits.

#  TAG: request_header_replace
#	Usage:   request_header_replace header_name message
#	Example: request_header_replace User-Agent Nutscrape/1.0 (CP/M; 8-bit)
#
#	This option allows you to change the contents of headers
#	denied with request_header_access above, by replacing them
#	with some fixed string.
#
#	This only applies to request headers, not reply headers.
#
#	By default, headers are removed if denied.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: reply_header_replace
#        Usage:   reply_header_replace header_name message
#        Example: reply_header_replace Server Foo/1.0
#
#        This option allows you to change the contents of headers
#        denied with reply_header_access above, by replacing them
#        with some fixed string.
#
#        This only applies to reply headers, not request headers.
#
#        By default, headers are removed if denied.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: request_header_add
#	Usage:   request_header_add field-name field-value acl1 [acl2] ...
#	Example: request_header_add X-Client-CA "CA=%ssl::>cert_issuer" all
#
#	This option adds header fields to outgoing HTTP requests (i.e.,
#	request headers sent by Squid to the next HTTP hop such as a
#	cache peer or an origin server). The option has no effect during
#	cache hit detection. The equivalent adaptation vectoring point
#	in ICAP terminology is post-cache REQMOD.
#
#	Field-name is a token specifying an HTTP header name. If a
#	standard HTTP header name is used, Squid does not check whether
#	the new header conflicts with any existing headers or violates
#	HTTP rules. If the request to be modified already contains a
#	field with the same name, the old field is preserved but the
#	header field values are not merged.
#
#	Field-value is either a token or a quoted string. If quoted
#	string format is used, then the surrounding quotes are removed
#	while escape sequences and %macros are processed.
#
#	In theory, all of the logformat codes can be used as %macros.
#	However, unlike logging (which happens at the very end of
#	transaction lifetime), the transaction may not yet have enough
#	information to expand a macro when the new header value is needed.
#	And some information may already be available to Squid but not yet
#	committed where the macro expansion code can access it (report
#	such instances!). The macro will be expanded into a single dash
#	('-') in such cases. Not all macros have been tested.
#
#	One or more Squid ACLs may be specified to restrict header
#	injection to matching requests. As always in squid.conf, all
#	ACLs in an option ACL list must be satisfied for the insertion
#	to happen. The request_header_add option supports fast ACLs
#	only.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: note
#	This option used to log custom information about the master
#	transaction. For example, an admin may configure Squid to log
#	which "user group" the transaction belongs to, where "user group"
#	will be determined based on a set of ACLs and not [just]
#	authentication information.
#	Values of key/value pairs can be logged using %{key}note macros:
#
#	    note key value acl ...
#	    logformat myFormat ... %{key}note ...
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: relaxed_header_parser	on|off|warn
#	In the default "on" setting Squid accepts certain forms
#	of non-compliant HTTP messages where it is unambiguous
#	what the sending application intended even if the message
#	is not correctly formatted. The messages is then normalized
#	to the correct form when forwarded by Squid.
#
#	If set to "warn" then a warning will be emitted in cache.log
#	each time such HTTP error is encountered.
#
#	If set to "off" then such HTTP errors will cause the request
#	or response to be rejected.
#Default:
# relaxed_header_parser on

# TIMEOUTS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: forward_timeout	time-units
#	This parameter specifies how long Squid should at most attempt in
#	finding a forwarding path for the request before giving up.
#Default:
# forward_timeout 4 minutes

#  TAG: connect_timeout	time-units
#	This parameter specifies how long to wait for the TCP connect to
#	the requested server or peer to complete before Squid should
#	attempt to find another path where to forward the request.
#Default:
# connect_timeout 1 minute

#  TAG: peer_connect_timeout	time-units
#	This parameter specifies how long to wait for a pending TCP
#	connection to a peer cache.  The default is 30 seconds.   You
#	may also set different timeout values for individual neighbors
#	with the 'connect-timeout' option on a 'cache_peer' line.
#Default:
# peer_connect_timeout 30 seconds

#  TAG: read_timeout	time-units
#	The read_timeout is applied on server-side connections.  After
#	each successful read(), the timeout will be extended by this
#	amount.  If no data is read again after this amount of time,
#	the request is aborted and logged with ERR_READ_TIMEOUT.  The
#	default is 15 minutes.
#Default:
# read_timeout 15 minutes

#  TAG: write_timeout	time-units
#	This timeout is tracked for all connections that have data
#	available for writing and are waiting for the socket to become
#	ready. After each successful write, the timeout is extended by
#	the configured amount. If Squid has data to write but the
#	connection is not ready for the configured duration, the
#	transaction associated with the connection is terminated. The
#	default is 15 minutes.
#Default:
# write_timeout 15 minutes

#  TAG: request_timeout
#	How long to wait for complete HTTP request headers after initial
#	connection establishment.
#Default:
# request_timeout 5 minutes

#  TAG: client_idle_pconn_timeout
#	How long to wait for the next HTTP request on a persistent
#	client connection after the previous request completes.
#Default:
# client_idle_pconn_timeout 2 minutes

#  TAG: client_lifetime	time-units
#	The maximum amount of time a client (browser) is allowed to
#	remain connected to the cache process.  This protects the Cache
#	from having a lot of sockets (and hence file descriptors) tied up
#	in a CLOSE_WAIT state from remote clients that go away without
#	properly shutting down (either because of a network failure or
#	because of a poor client implementation).  The default is one
#	day, 1440 minutes.
#
#	NOTE:  The default value is intended to be much larger than any
#	client would ever need to be connected to your cache.  You
#	should probably change client_lifetime only as a last resort.
#	If you seem to have many client connections tying up
#	filedescriptors, we recommend first tuning the read_timeout,
#	request_timeout, persistent_request_timeout and quick_abort values.
#Default:
# client_lifetime 1 day

#  TAG: half_closed_clients
#	Some clients may shutdown the sending side of their TCP
#	connections, while leaving their receiving sides open.	Sometimes,
#	Squid can not tell the difference between a half-closed and a
#	fully-closed TCP connection.
#
#	By default, Squid will immediately close client connections when
#	read(2) returns "no more data to read."
#
#	Change this option to 'on' and Squid will keep open connections
#	until a read(2) or write(2) on the socket returns an error.
#	This may show some benefits for reverse proxies. But if not
#	it is recommended to leave OFF.
#Default:
# half_closed_clients off

#  TAG: server_idle_pconn_timeout
#	Timeout for idle persistent connections to servers and other
#	proxies.
#Default:
# server_idle_pconn_timeout 1 minute

#  TAG: ident_timeout
#	Maximum time to wait for IDENT lookups to complete.
#
#	If this is too high, and you enabled IDENT lookups from untrusted
#	users, you might be susceptible to denial-of-service by having
#	many ident requests going at once.
#Default:
# ident_timeout 10 seconds

#  TAG: shutdown_lifetime	time-units
#	When SIGTERM or SIGHUP is received, the cache is put into
#	"shutdown pending" mode until all active sockets are closed.
#	This value is the lifetime to set for all open descriptors
#	during shutdown mode.  Any active clients after this many
#	seconds will receive a 'timeout' message.
#Default:
# shutdown_lifetime 30 seconds

# ADMINISTRATIVE PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_mgr
#	Email-address of local cache manager who will receive
#	mail if the cache dies.  The default is "webmaster".
#Default:
# cache_mgr webmaster

#  TAG: mail_from
#	From: email-address for mail sent when the cache dies.
#	The default is to use 'squid@unique_hostname'.
#
#	See also: unique_hostname directive.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: mail_program
#	Email program used to send mail if the cache dies.
#	The default is "mail". The specified program must comply
#	with the standard Unix mail syntax:
#	  mail-program recipient < mailfile
#
#	Optional command line options can be specified.
#Default:
# mail_program mail

#  TAG: cache_effective_user
#	If you start Squid as root, it will change its effective/real
#	UID/GID to the user specified below.  The default is to change
#	to UID of proxy.
#	see also; cache_effective_group
#Default:
# cache_effective_user proxy

#  TAG: cache_effective_group
#	Squid sets the GID to the effective user's default group ID
#	(taken from the password file) and supplementary group list
#	from the groups membership.
#
#	If you want Squid to run with a specific GID regardless of
#	the group memberships of the effective user then set this
#	to the group (or GID) you want Squid to run as. When set
#	all other group privileges of the effective user are ignored
#	and only this GID is effective. If Squid is not started as
#	root the user starting Squid MUST be member of the specified
#	group.
#
#	This option is not recommended by the Squid Team.
#	Our preference is for administrators to configure a secure
#	user account for squid with UID/GID matching system policies.
#Default:
# Use system group memberships of the cache_effective_user account

#  TAG: httpd_suppress_version_string	on|off
#	Suppress Squid version string info in HTTP headers and HTML error pages.
#Default:
# httpd_suppress_version_string off

#  TAG: visible_hostname
#	If you want to present a special hostname in error messages, etc,
#	define this.  Otherwise, the return value of gethostname()
#	will be used. If you have multiple caches in a cluster and
#	get errors about IP-forwarding you must set them to have individual
#	names with this setting.
#Default:
# Automatically detect the system host name

#  TAG: unique_hostname
#	If you want to have multiple machines with the same
#	'visible_hostname' you must give each machine a different
#	'unique_hostname' so forwarding loops can be detected.
#Default:
# Copy the value from visible_hostname

#  TAG: hostname_aliases
#	A list of other DNS names your cache has.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: umask
#	Minimum umask which should be enforced while the proxy
#	is running, in addition to the umask set at startup.
#
#	For a traditional octal representation of umasks, start
#        your value with 0.
#Default:
# umask 027

# OPTIONS FOR THE CACHE REGISTRATION SERVICE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	This section contains parameters for the (optional) cache
#	announcement service.  This service is provided to help
#	cache administrators locate one another in order to join or
#	create cache hierarchies.
#
#	An 'announcement' message is sent (via UDP) to the registration
#	service by Squid.  By default, the announcement message is NOT
#	SENT unless you enable it with 'announce_period' below.
#
#	The announcement message includes your hostname, plus the
#	following information from this configuration file:
#
#		http_port
#		icp_port
#		cache_mgr
#
#	All current information is processed regularly and made
#	available on the Web at http://www.ircache.net/Cache/Tracker/.

#  TAG: announce_period
#	This is how frequently to send cache announcements.
#
#	To enable announcing your cache, just set an announce period.
#
#	Example:
#		announce_period 1 day
#Default:
# Announcement messages disabled.

#  TAG: announce_host
#	Set the hostname where announce registration messages will be sent.
#
#	See also announce_port and announce_file
#Default:
# announce_host tracker.ircache.net

#  TAG: announce_file
#	The contents of this file will be included in the announce
#	registration messages.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: announce_port
#	Set the port where announce registration messages will be sent.
#
#	See also announce_host and announce_file
#Default:
# announce_port 3131

# HTTPD-ACCELERATOR OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: httpd_accel_surrogate_id
#	Surrogates (http://www.esi.org/architecture_spec_1.0.html)
#	need an identification token to allow control targeting. Because
#	a farm of surrogates may all perform the same tasks, they may share
#	an identification token.
#Default:
# visible_hostname is used if no specific ID is set.

#  TAG: http_accel_surrogate_remote	on|off
#	Remote surrogates (such as those in a CDN) honour the header
#	"Surrogate-Control: no-store-remote".
#
#	Set this to on to have squid behave as a remote surrogate.
#Default:
# http_accel_surrogate_remote off

#  TAG: esi_parser	libxml2|expat|custom
#	ESI markup is not strictly XML compatible. The custom ESI parser
#	will give higher performance, but cannot handle non ASCII character
#	encodings.
#Default:
# esi_parser custom

# DELAY POOL PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: delay_pools
#	This represents the number of delay pools to be used.  For example,
#	if you have one class 2 delay pool and one class 3 delays pool, you
#	have a total of 2 delay pools.
#
#	See also delay_parameters, delay_class, delay_access for pool
#	configuration details.
#Default:
# delay_pools 0

#  TAG: delay_class
#	This defines the class of each delay pool.  There must be exactly one
#	delay_class line for each delay pool.  For example, to define two
#	delay pools, one of class 2 and one of class 3, the settings above
#	and here would be:
#
#	Example:
#	    delay_pools 4      # 4 delay pools
#	    delay_class 1 2    # pool 1 is a class 2 pool
#	    delay_class 2 3    # pool 2 is a class 3 pool
#	    delay_class 3 4    # pool 3 is a class 4 pool
#	    delay_class 4 5    # pool 4 is a class 5 pool
#
#	The delay pool classes are:
#
#		class 1		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket.
#
#		class 2 	Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket as well as an "individual" bucket chosen
#				from bits 25 through 32 of the IPv4 address.
#
#		class 3		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket as well as a "network" bucket chosen
#				from bits 17 through 24 of the IP address and a
#				"individual" bucket chosen from bits 17 through
#				32 of the IPv4 address.
#
#		class 4		Everything in a class 3 delay pool, with an
#				additional limit on a per user basis. This
#				only takes effect if the username is established
#				in advance - by forcing authentication in your
#				http_access rules.
#
#		class 5		Requests are grouped according their tag (see
#				external_acl's tag= reply).
#
#
#	Each pool also requires a delay_parameters directive to configure the pool size
#	and speed limits used whenever the pool is applied to a request. Along with
#	a set of delay_access directives to determine when it is used.
#
#	NOTE: If an IP address is a.b.c.d
#		-> bits 25 through 32 are "d"
#		-> bits 17 through 24 are "c"
#		-> bits 17 through 32 are "c * 256 + d"
#
#	NOTE-2: Due to the use of bitmasks in class 2,3,4 pools they only apply to
#		IPv4 traffic. Class 1 and 5 pools may be used with IPv6 traffic.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#	See also delay_parameters and delay_access.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_access
#	This is used to determine which delay pool a request falls into.
#
#	delay_access is sorted per pool and the matching starts with pool 1,
#	then pool 2, ..., and finally pool N. The first delay pool where the
#	request is allowed is selected for the request. If it does not allow
#	the request to any pool then the request is not delayed (default).
#
#	For example, if you want some_big_clients in delay
#	pool 1 and lotsa_little_clients in delay pool 2:
#
#		delay_access 1 allow some_big_clients
#		delay_access 1 deny all
#		delay_access 2 allow lotsa_little_clients
#		delay_access 2 deny all
#		delay_access 3 allow authenticated_clients
#
#	See also delay_parameters and delay_class.
#
#Default:
# Deny using the pool, unless allow rules exist in squid.conf for the pool.

#  TAG: delay_parameters
#	This defines the parameters for a delay pool.  Each delay pool has
#	a number of "buckets" associated with it, as explained in the
#	description of delay_class.
#
#	For a class 1 delay pool, the syntax is:
#		delay_pools pool 1
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate
#
#	For a class 2 delay pool:
#		delay_pools pool 2
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate individual
#
#	For a class 3 delay pool:
#		delay_pools pool 3
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual
#
#	For a class 4 delay pool:
#		delay_pools pool 4
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual user
#
#	For a class 5 delay pool:
#		delay_pools pool 5
#		delay_parameters pool tagrate
#
#	The option variables are:
#
#		pool		a pool number - ie, a number between 1 and the
#				number specified in delay_pools as used in
#				delay_class lines.
#
#		aggregate	the speed limit parameters for the aggregate bucket
#				(class 1, 2, 3).
#
#		individual	the speed limit parameters for the individual
#				buckets (class 2, 3).
#
#		network		the speed limit parameters for the network buckets
#				(class 3).
#
#		user		the speed limit parameters for the user buckets
#				(class 4).
#
#		tagrate		the speed limit parameters for the tag buckets
#				(class 5).
#
#	A pair of delay parameters is written restore/maximum, where restore is
#	the number of bytes (not bits - modem and network speeds are usually
#	quoted in bits) per second placed into the bucket, and maximum is the
#	maximum number of bytes which can be in the bucket at any time.
#
#	There must be one delay_parameters line for each delay pool.
#
#
#	For example, if delay pool number 1 is a class 2 delay pool as in the
#	above example, and is being used to strictly limit each host to 64Kbit/sec
#	(plus overheads), with no overall limit, the line is:
#
#		delay_parameters 1 -1/-1 8000/8000
#
#	Note that 8 x 8000 KByte/sec -> 64Kbit/sec.
#
#	Note that the figure -1 is used to represent "unlimited".
#
#
#	And, if delay pool number 2 is a class 3 delay pool as in the above
#	example, and you want to limit it to a total of 256Kbit/sec (strict limit)
#	with each 8-bit network permitted 64Kbit/sec (strict limit) and each
#	individual host permitted 4800bit/sec with a bucket maximum size of 64Kbits
#	to permit a decent web page to be downloaded at a decent speed
#	(if the network is not being limited due to overuse) but slow down
#	large downloads more significantly:
#
#		delay_parameters 2 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/8000
#
#	Note that 8 x 32000 KByte/sec -> 256Kbit/sec.
#		  8 x  8000 KByte/sec ->  64Kbit/sec.
#		  8 x   600 Byte/sec  -> 4800bit/sec.
#
#
#	Finally, for a class 4 delay pool as in the example - each user will
#	be limited to 128Kbits/sec no matter how many workstations they are logged into.:
#
#		delay_parameters 4 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/64000 16000/16000
#
#
#	See also delay_class and delay_access.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_initial_bucket_level	(percent, 0-100)
#	The initial bucket percentage is used to determine how much is put
#	in each bucket when squid starts, is reconfigured, or first notices
#	a host accessing it (in class 2 and class 3, individual hosts and
#	networks only have buckets associated with them once they have been
#	"seen" by squid).
#Default:
# delay_initial_bucket_level 50

# CLIENT DELAY POOL PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: client_delay_pools
#	This option specifies the number of client delay pools used. It must
#	preceed other client_delay_* options.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_pools 2
#
#	See also client_delay_parameters and client_delay_access.
#Default:
# client_delay_pools 0

#  TAG: client_delay_initial_bucket_level	(percent, 0-no_limit)
#	This option determines the initial bucket size as a percentage of
#	max_bucket_size from client_delay_parameters. Buckets are created
#	at the time of the "first" connection from the matching IP. Idle
#	buckets are periodically deleted up.
#
#	You can specify more than 100 percent but note that such "oversized"
#	buckets are not refilled until their size goes down to max_bucket_size
#	from client_delay_parameters.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_initial_bucket_level 50
#Default:
# client_delay_initial_bucket_level 50

#  TAG: client_delay_parameters
#
#	This option configures client-side bandwidth limits using the
#	following format:
#
#	    client_delay_parameters pool speed_limit max_bucket_size
#
#	pool is an integer ID used for client_delay_access matching.
#
#	speed_limit is bytes added to the bucket per second.
#
#	max_bucket_size is the maximum size of a bucket, enforced after any
#	speed_limit additions.
#
#	Please see the delay_parameters option for more information and
#	examples.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_parameters 1 1024 2048
#		client_delay_parameters 2 51200 16384
#
#	See also client_delay_access.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: client_delay_access
#	This option determines the client-side delay pool for the
#	request:
#
#	    client_delay_access pool_ID allow|deny acl_name
#
#	All client_delay_access options are checked in their pool ID
#	order, starting with pool 1. The first checked pool with allowed
#	request is selected for the request. If no ACL matches or there
#	are no client_delay_access options, the request bandwidth is not
#	limited.
#
#	The ACL-selected pool is then used to find the
#	client_delay_parameters for the request. Client-side pools are
#	not used to aggregate clients. Clients are always aggregated
#	based on their source IP addresses (one bucket per source IP).
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#	Additionally, only the client TCP connection details are available.
#	ACLs testing HTTP properties will not work.
#
#	Please see delay_access for more examples.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_access 1 allow low_rate_network
#		client_delay_access 2 allow vips_network
#
#
#	See also client_delay_parameters and client_delay_pools.
#Default:
# Deny use of the pool, unless allow rules exist in squid.conf for the pool.

# WCCPv1 AND WCCPv2 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: wccp_router
#	Use this option to define your WCCP ``home'' router for
#	Squid.
#
#	wccp_router supports a single WCCP(v1) router
#
#	wccp2_router supports multiple WCCPv2 routers
#
#	only one of the two may be used at the same time and defines
#	which version of WCCP to use.
#Default:
# WCCP disabled.

#  TAG: wccp2_router
#	Use this option to define your WCCP ``home'' router for
#	Squid.
#
#	wccp_router supports a single WCCP(v1) router
#
#	wccp2_router supports multiple WCCPv2 routers
#
#	only one of the two may be used at the same time and defines
#	which version of WCCP to use.
#Default:
# WCCPv2 disabled.

#  TAG: wccp_version
#	This directive is only relevant if you need to set up WCCP(v1)
#	to some very old and end-of-life Cisco routers. In all other
#	setups it must be left unset or at the default setting.
#	It defines an internal version in the WCCP(v1) protocol,
#	with version 4 being the officially documented protocol.
#
#	According to some users, Cisco IOS 11.2 and earlier only
#	support WCCP version 3.  If you're using that or an earlier
#	version of IOS, you may need to change this value to 3, otherwise
#	do not specify this parameter.
#Default:
# wccp_version 4

#  TAG: wccp2_rebuild_wait
#	If this is enabled Squid will wait for the cache dir rebuild to finish
#	before sending the first wccp2 HereIAm packet
#Default:
# wccp2_rebuild_wait on

#  TAG: wccp2_forwarding_method
#	WCCP2 allows the setting of forwarding methods between the
#	router/switch and the cache.  Valid values are as follows:
#
#	gre - GRE encapsulation (forward the packet in a GRE/WCCP tunnel)
#	l2  - L2 redirect (forward the packet using Layer 2/MAC rewriting)
#
#	Currently (as of IOS 12.4) cisco routers only support GRE.
#	Cisco switches only support the L2 redirect assignment method.
#Default:
# wccp2_forwarding_method gre

#  TAG: wccp2_return_method
#	WCCP2 allows the setting of return methods between the
#	router/switch and the cache for packets that the cache
#	decides not to handle.  Valid values are as follows:
#
#	gre - GRE encapsulation (forward the packet in a GRE/WCCP tunnel)
#	l2  - L2 redirect (forward the packet using Layer 2/MAC rewriting)
#
#	Currently (as of IOS 12.4) cisco routers only support GRE.
#	Cisco switches only support the L2 redirect assignment.
#
#	If the "ip wccp redirect exclude in" command has been
#	enabled on the cache interface, then it is still safe for
#	the proxy server to use a l2 redirect method even if this
#	option is set to GRE.
#Default:
# wccp2_return_method gre

#  TAG: wccp2_assignment_method
#	WCCP2 allows the setting of methods to assign the WCCP hash
#	Valid values are as follows:
#
#	hash - Hash assignment
#	mask - Mask assignment
#
#	As a general rule, cisco routers support the hash assignment method
#	and cisco switches support the mask assignment method.
#Default:
# wccp2_assignment_method hash

#  TAG: wccp2_service
#	WCCP2 allows for multiple traffic services. There are two
#	types: "standard" and "dynamic". The standard type defines
#	one service id - http (id 0). The dynamic service ids can be from
#	51 to 255 inclusive.  In order to use a dynamic service id
#	one must define the type of traffic to be redirected; this is done
#	using the wccp2_service_info option.
#
#	The "standard" type does not require a wccp2_service_info option,
#	just specifying the service id will suffice.
#
#	MD5 service authentication can be enabled by adding
#	"password=<password>" to the end of this service declaration.
#
#	Examples:
#
#	wccp2_service standard 0	# for the 'web-cache' standard service
#	wccp2_service dynamic 80	# a dynamic service type which will be
#					# fleshed out with subsequent options.
#	wccp2_service standard 0 password=foo
#Default:
# Use the 'web-cache' standard service.

#  TAG: wccp2_service_info
#	Dynamic WCCPv2 services require further information to define the
#	traffic you wish to have diverted.
#
#	The format is:
#
#	wccp2_service_info <id> protocol=<protocol> flags=<flag>,<flag>..
#	    priority=<priority> ports=<port>,<port>..
#
#	The relevant WCCPv2 flags:
#	+ src_ip_hash, dst_ip_hash
#	+ source_port_hash, dst_port_hash
#	+ src_ip_alt_hash, dst_ip_alt_hash
#	+ src_port_alt_hash, dst_port_alt_hash
#	+ ports_source
#
#	The port list can be one to eight entries.
#
#	Example:
#
#	wccp2_service_info 80 protocol=tcp flags=src_ip_hash,ports_source
#	    priority=240 ports=80
#
#	Note: the service id must have been defined by a previous
#	'wccp2_service dynamic <id>' entry.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: wccp2_weight
#	Each cache server gets assigned a set of the destination
#	hash proportional to their weight.
#Default:
# wccp2_weight 10000

#  TAG: wccp_address
#	Use this option if you require WCCPv2 to use a specific
#	interface address.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#Default:
# Address selected by the operating system.

#  TAG: wccp2_address
#	Use this option if you require WCCP to use a specific
#	interface address.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#Default:
# Address selected by the operating system.

# PERSISTENT CONNECTION HANDLING
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Also see "pconn_timeout" in the TIMEOUTS section

#  TAG: client_persistent_connections
#	Persistent connection support for clients.
#	Squid uses persistent connections (when allowed). You can use
#	this option to disable persistent connections with clients.
#Default:
# client_persistent_connections on

#  TAG: server_persistent_connections
#	Persistent connection support for servers.
#	Squid uses persistent connections (when allowed). You can use
#	this option to disable persistent connections with servers.
#Default:
# server_persistent_connections on

#  TAG: persistent_connection_after_error
#	With this directive the use of persistent connections after
#	HTTP errors can be disabled. Useful if you have clients
#	who fail to handle errors on persistent connections proper.
#Default:
# persistent_connection_after_error on

#  TAG: detect_broken_pconn
#	Some servers have been found to incorrectly signal the use
#	of HTTP/1.0 persistent connections even on replies not
#	compatible, causing significant delays. This server problem
#	has mostly been seen on redirects.
#
#	By enabling this directive Squid attempts to detect such
#	broken replies and automatically assume the reply is finished
#	after 10 seconds timeout.
#Default:
# detect_broken_pconn off

# CACHE DIGEST OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: digest_generation
#	This controls whether the server will generate a Cache Digest
#	of its contents.  By default, Cache Digest generation is
#	enabled if Squid is compiled with --enable-cache-digests defined.
#Default:
# digest_generation on

#  TAG: digest_bits_per_entry
#	This is the number of bits of the server's Cache Digest which
#	will be associated with the Digest entry for a given HTTP
#	Method and URL (public key) combination.  The default is 5.
#Default:
# digest_bits_per_entry 5

#  TAG: digest_rebuild_period	(seconds)
#	This is the wait time between Cache Digest rebuilds.
#Default:
# digest_rebuild_period 1 hour

#  TAG: digest_rewrite_period	(seconds)
#	This is the wait time between Cache Digest writes to
#	disk.
#Default:
# digest_rewrite_period 1 hour

#  TAG: digest_swapout_chunk_size	(bytes)
#	This is the number of bytes of the Cache Digest to write to
#	disk at a time.  It defaults to 4096 bytes (4KB), the Squid
#	default swap page.
#Default:
# digest_swapout_chunk_size 4096 bytes

#  TAG: digest_rebuild_chunk_percentage	(percent, 0-100)
#	This is the percentage of the Cache Digest to be scanned at a
#	time.  By default it is set to 10% of the Cache Digest.
#Default:
# digest_rebuild_chunk_percentage 10

# SNMP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: snmp_port
#	The port number where Squid listens for SNMP requests. To enable
#	SNMP support set this to a suitable port number. Port number
#	3401 is often used for the Squid SNMP agent. By default it's
#	set to "0" (disabled)
#
#	Example:
#		snmp_port 3401
#Default:
# SNMP disabled.

#  TAG: snmp_access
#	Allowing or denying access to the SNMP port.
#
#	All access to the agent is denied by default.
#	usage:
#
#	snmp_access allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#Example:
# snmp_access allow snmppublic localhost
# snmp_access deny all
#Default:
# Deny, unless rules exist in squid.conf.

#  TAG: snmp_incoming_address
#	Just like 'udp_incoming_address', but for the SNMP port.
#
#	snmp_incoming_address	is used for the SNMP socket receiving
#				messages from SNMP agents.
#
#	The default snmp_incoming_address is to listen on all
#	available network interfaces.
#Default:
# Accept SNMP packets from all machine interfaces.

#  TAG: snmp_outgoing_address
#	Just like 'udp_outgoing_address', but for the SNMP port.
#
#	snmp_outgoing_address	is used for SNMP packets returned to SNMP
#				agents.
#
#	If snmp_outgoing_address is not set it will use the same socket
#	as snmp_incoming_address. Only change this if you want to have
#	SNMP replies sent using another address than where this Squid
#	listens for SNMP queries.
#
#	NOTE, snmp_incoming_address and snmp_outgoing_address can not have
#	the same value since they both use the same port.
#Default:
# Use snmp_incoming_address or an address selected by the operating system.

# ICP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: icp_port
#	The port number where Squid sends and receives ICP queries to
#	and from neighbor caches.  The standard UDP port for ICP is 3130.
#
#	Example:
#		icp_port 3130
#Default:
# ICP disabled.

#  TAG: htcp_port
#	The port number where Squid sends and receives HTCP queries to
#	and from neighbor caches.  To turn it on you want to set it to
#	4827.
#
#	Example:
#		htcp_port 4827
#Default:
# HTCP disabled.

#  TAG: log_icp_queries	on|off
#	If set, ICP queries are logged to access.log. You may wish
#	do disable this if your ICP load is VERY high to speed things
#	up or to simplify log analysis.
#Default:
# log_icp_queries on

#  TAG: udp_incoming_address
#	udp_incoming_address	is used for UDP packets received from other
#				caches.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#
#	Only change this if you want to have all UDP queries received on
#	a specific interface/address.
#
#	NOTE: udp_incoming_address is used by the ICP, HTCP, and DNS
#	modules. Altering it will affect all of them in the same manner.
#
#	see also; udp_outgoing_address
#
#	NOTE, udp_incoming_address and udp_outgoing_address can not
#	have the same value since they both use the same port.
#Default:
# Accept packets from all machine interfaces.

#  TAG: udp_outgoing_address
#	udp_outgoing_address	is used for UDP packets sent out to other
#				caches.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#
#	Instead it will use the same socket as udp_incoming_address.
#	Only change this if you want to have UDP queries sent using another
#	address than where this Squid listens for UDP queries from other
#	caches.
#
#	NOTE: udp_outgoing_address is used by the ICP, HTCP, and DNS
#	modules. Altering it will affect all of them in the same manner.
#
#	see also; udp_incoming_address
#
#	NOTE, udp_incoming_address and udp_outgoing_address can not
#	have the same value since they both use the same port.
#Default:
# Use udp_incoming_address or an address selected by the operating system.

#  TAG: icp_hit_stale	on|off
#	If you want to return ICP_HIT for stale cache objects, set this
#	option to 'on'.  If you have sibling relationships with caches
#	in other administrative domains, this should be 'off'.  If you only
#	have sibling relationships with caches under your control,
#	it is probably okay to set this to 'on'.
#	If set to 'on', your siblings should use the option "allow-miss"
#	on their cache_peer lines for connecting to you.
#Default:
# icp_hit_stale off

#  TAG: minimum_direct_hops
#	If using the ICMP pinging stuff, do direct fetches for sites
#	which are no more than this many hops away.
#Default:
# minimum_direct_hops 4

#  TAG: minimum_direct_rtt	(msec)
#	If using the ICMP pinging stuff, do direct fetches for sites
#	which are no more than this many rtt milliseconds away.
#Default:
# minimum_direct_rtt 400

#  TAG: netdb_low
#	The low water mark for the ICMP measurement database.
#
#	Note: high watermark controlled by netdb_high directive.
#
#	These watermarks are counts, not percents.  The defaults are
#	(low) 900 and (high) 1000.  When the high water mark is
#	reached, database entries will be deleted until the low
#	mark is reached.
#Default:
# netdb_low 900

#  TAG: netdb_high
#	The high water mark for the ICMP measurement database.
#
#	Note: low watermark controlled by netdb_low directive.
#
#	These watermarks are counts, not percents.  The defaults are
#	(low) 900 and (high) 1000.  When the high water mark is
#	reached, database entries will be deleted until the low
#	mark is reached.
#Default:
# netdb_high 1000

#  TAG: netdb_ping_period
#	The minimum period for measuring a site.  There will be at
#	least this much delay between successive pings to the same
#	network.  The default is five minutes.
#Default:
# netdb_ping_period 5 minutes

#  TAG: query_icmp	on|off
#	If you want to ask your peers to include ICMP data in their ICP
#	replies, enable this option.
#
#	If your peer has configured Squid (during compilation) with
#	'--enable-icmp' that peer will send ICMP pings to origin server
#	sites of the URLs it receives.  If you enable this option the
#	ICP replies from that peer will include the ICMP data (if available).
#	Then, when choosing a parent cache, Squid will choose the parent with
#	the minimal RTT to the origin server.  When this happens, the
#	hierarchy field of the access.log will be
#	"CLOSEST_PARENT_MISS".  This option is off by default.
#Default:
# query_icmp off

#  TAG: test_reachability	on|off
#	When this is 'on', ICP MISS replies will be ICP_MISS_NOFETCH
#	instead of ICP_MISS if the target host is NOT in the ICMP
#	database, or has a zero RTT.
#Default:
# test_reachability off

#  TAG: icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally Squid will automatically determine an optimal ICP
#	query timeout value based on the round-trip-time of recent ICP
#	queries.  If you want to override the value determined by
#	Squid, set this 'icp_query_timeout' to a non-zero value.  This
#	value is specified in MILLISECONDS, so, to use a 2-second
#	timeout (the old default), you would write:
#
#		icp_query_timeout 2000
#Default:
# Dynamic detection.

#  TAG: maximum_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally the ICP query timeout is determined dynamically.  But
#	sometimes it can lead to very large values (say 5 seconds).
#	Use this option to put an upper limit on the dynamic timeout
#	value.  Do NOT use this option to always use a fixed (instead
#	of a dynamic) timeout value. To set a fixed timeout see the
#	'icp_query_timeout' directive.
#Default:
# maximum_icp_query_timeout 2000

#  TAG: minimum_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally the ICP query timeout is determined dynamically.  But
#	sometimes it can lead to very small timeouts, even lower than
#	the normal latency variance on your link due to traffic.
#	Use this option to put an lower limit on the dynamic timeout
#	value.  Do NOT use this option to always use a fixed (instead
#	of a dynamic) timeout value. To set a fixed timeout see the
#	'icp_query_timeout' directive.
#Default:
# minimum_icp_query_timeout 5

#  TAG: background_ping_rate	time-units
#	Controls how often the ICP pings are sent to siblings that
#	have background-ping set.
#Default:
# background_ping_rate 10 seconds

# MULTICAST ICP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: mcast_groups
#	This tag specifies a list of multicast groups which your server
#	should join to receive multicasted ICP queries.
#
#	NOTE!  Be very careful what you put here!  Be sure you
#	understand the difference between an ICP _query_ and an ICP
#	_reply_.  This option is to be set only if you want to RECEIVE
#	multicast queries.  Do NOT set this option to SEND multicast
#	ICP (use cache_peer for that).  ICP replies are always sent via
#	unicast, so this option does not affect whether or not you will
#	receive replies from multicast group members.
#
#	You must be very careful to NOT use a multicast address which
#	is already in use by another group of caches.
#
#	If you are unsure about multicast, please read the Multicast
#	chapter in the Squid FAQ (http://www.squid-cache.org/FAQ/).
#
#	Usage: mcast_groups 239.128.16.128 224.0.1.20
#
#	By default, Squid doesn't listen on any multicast groups.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: mcast_miss_addr
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	If you enable this option, every "cache miss" URL will
#	be sent out on the specified multicast address.
#
#	Do not enable this option unless you are are absolutely
#	certain you understand what you are doing.
#Default:
# disabled.

#  TAG: mcast_miss_ttl
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	This is the time-to-live value for packets multicasted
#	when multicasting off cache miss URLs is enabled.  By
#	default this is set to 'site scope', i.e. 16.
#Default:
# mcast_miss_ttl 16

#  TAG: mcast_miss_port
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	This is the port number to be used in conjunction with
#	'mcast_miss_addr'.
#Default:
# mcast_miss_port 3135

#  TAG: mcast_miss_encode_key
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	The URLs that are sent in the multicast miss stream are
#	encrypted.  This is the encryption key.
#Default:
# mcast_miss_encode_key XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

#  TAG: mcast_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	For multicast peers, Squid regularly sends out ICP "probes" to
#	count how many other peers are listening on the given multicast
#	address.  This value specifies how long Squid should wait to
#	count all the replies.  The default is 2000 msec, or 2
#	seconds.
#Default:
# mcast_icp_query_timeout 2000

# INTERNAL ICON OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: icon_directory
#	Where the icons are stored. These are normally kept in
#	/usr/share/squid3/icons
#Default:
# icon_directory /usr/share/squid3/icons

#  TAG: global_internal_static
#	This directive controls is Squid should intercept all requests for
#	/squid-internal-static/ no matter which host the URL is requesting
#	(default on setting), or if nothing special should be done for
#	such URLs (off setting). The purpose of this directive is to make
#	icons etc work better in complex cache hierarchies where it may
#	not always be possible for all corners in the cache mesh to reach
#	the server generating a directory listing.
#Default:
# global_internal_static on

#  TAG: short_icon_urls
#	If this is enabled Squid will use short URLs for icons.
#	If disabled it will revert to the old behavior of including
#	it's own name and port in the URL.
#
#	If you run a complex cache hierarchy with a mix of Squid and
#	other proxies you may need to disable this directive.
#Default:
# short_icon_urls on

# ERROR PAGE OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: error_directory
#	If you wish to create your own versions of the default
#	error files to customize them to suit your company copy
#	the error/template files to another directory and point
#	this tag at them.
#
#	WARNING: This option will disable multi-language support
#	         on error pages if used.
#
#	The squid developers are interested in making squid available in
#	a wide variety of languages. If you are making translations for a
#	language that Squid does not currently provide please consider
#	contributing your translation back to the project.
#	http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Translations
#
#	The squid developers working on translations are happy to supply drop-in
#	translated error files in exchange for any new language contributions.
#Default:
# Send error pages in the clients preferred language

#  TAG: error_default_language
#	Set the default language which squid will send error pages in
#	if no existing translation matches the clients language
#	preferences.
#
#	If unset (default) generic English will be used.
#
#	The squid developers are interested in making squid available in
#	a wide variety of languages. If you are interested in making
#	translations for any language see the squid wiki for details.
#	http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Translations
#Default:
# Generate English language pages.

#  TAG: error_log_languages
#	Log to cache.log what languages users are attempting to
#	auto-negotiate for translations.
#
#	Successful negotiations are not logged. Only failures
#	have meaning to indicate that Squid may need an upgrade
#	of its error page translations.
#Default:
# error_log_languages on

#  TAG: err_page_stylesheet
#	CSS Stylesheet to pattern the display of Squid default error pages.
#
#	For information on CSS see http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/
#Default:
# err_page_stylesheet /etc/squid3/errorpage.css

#  TAG: err_html_text
#	HTML text to include in error messages.  Make this a "mailto"
#	URL to your admin address, or maybe just a link to your
#	organizations Web page.
#
#	To include this in your error messages, you must rewrite
#	the error template files (found in the "errors" directory).
#	Wherever you want the 'err_html_text' line to appear,
#	insert a %L tag in the error template file.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: email_err_data	on|off
#	If enabled, information about the occurred error will be
#	included in the mailto links of the ERR pages (if %W is set)
#	so that the email body contains the data.
#	Syntax is <A HREF="mailto:%w%W">%w</A>
#Default:
# email_err_data on

#  TAG: deny_info
#	Usage:   deny_info err_page_name acl
#	or       deny_info http://... acl
#	or       deny_info TCP_RESET acl
#
#	This can be used to return a ERR_ page for requests which
#	do not pass the 'http_access' rules.  Squid remembers the last
#	acl it evaluated in http_access, and if a 'deny_info' line exists
#	for that ACL Squid returns a corresponding error page.
#
#	The acl is typically the last acl on the http_access deny line which
#	denied access. The exceptions to this rule are:
#	- When Squid needs to request authentication credentials. It's then
#	  the first authentication related acl encountered
#	- When none of the http_access lines matches. It's then the last
#	  acl processed on the last http_access line.
#	- When the decision to deny access was made by an adaptation service,
#	  the acl name is the corresponding eCAP or ICAP service_name.
#
#	NP: If providing your own custom error pages with error_directory
#	    you may also specify them by your custom file name:
#	    Example: deny_info ERR_CUSTOM_ACCESS_DENIED bad_guys
#
#	By defaut Squid will send "403 Forbidden". A different 4xx or 5xx
#	may be specified by prefixing the file name with the code and a colon.
#	e.g. 404:ERR_CUSTOM_ACCESS_DENIED
#
#	Alternatively you can tell Squid to reset the TCP connection
#	by specifying TCP_RESET.
#
#	Or you can specify an error URL or URL pattern. The browsers will
#	get redirected to the specified URL after formatting tags have
#	been replaced. Redirect will be done with 302 or 307 according to
#	HTTP/1.1 specs. A different 3xx code may be specified by prefixing
#	the URL. e.g. 303:http://example.com/
#
#	URL FORMAT TAGS:
#		%a	- username (if available. Password NOT included)
#		%B	- FTP path URL
#		%e	- Error number
#		%E	- Error description
#		%h	- Squid hostname
#		%H	- Request domain name
#		%i	- Client IP Address
#		%M	- Request Method
#		%o	- Message result from external ACL helper
#		%p	- Request Port number
#		%P	- Request Protocol name
#		%R	- Request URL path
#		%T	- Timestamp in RFC 1123 format
#		%U	- Full canonical URL from client
#			  (HTTPS URLs terminate with *)
#		%u	- Full canonical URL from client
#		%w	- Admin email from squid.conf
#		%x	- Error name
#		%%	- Literal percent (%) code
#
#Default:
# none

# OPTIONS INFLUENCING REQUEST FORWARDING 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: nonhierarchical_direct
#	By default, Squid will send any non-hierarchical requests
#	(matching hierarchy_stoplist or not cacheable request type) direct
#	to origin servers.
#
#	When this is set to "off", Squid will prefer to send these
#	requests to parents.
#
#	Note that in most configurations, by turning this off you will only
#	add latency to these request without any improvement in global hit
#	ratio.
#
#	This option only sets a preference. If the parent is unavailable a
#	direct connection to the origin server may still be attempted. To
#	completely prevent direct connections use never_direct.
#Default:
# nonhierarchical_direct on

#  TAG: prefer_direct
#	Normally Squid tries to use parents for most requests. If you for some
#	reason like it to first try going direct and only use a parent if
#	going direct fails set this to on.
#
#	By combining nonhierarchical_direct off and prefer_direct on you
#	can set up Squid to use a parent as a backup path if going direct
#	fails.
#
#	Note: If you want Squid to use parents for all requests see
#	the never_direct directive. prefer_direct only modifies how Squid
#	acts on cacheable requests.
#Default:
# prefer_direct off

#  TAG: cache_miss_revalidate	on|off
#	RFC 7232 defines a conditional request mechanism to prevent
#	response objects being unnecessarily transferred over the network.
#	If that mechanism is used by the client and a cache MISS occurs
#	it can prevent new cache entries being created.
#
#	This option determines whether Squid on cache MISS will pass the
#	client revalidation request to the server or tries to fetch new
#	content for caching. It can be useful while the cache is mostly
#	empty to more quickly have the cache populated by generating
#	non-conditional GETs.
#
#	When set to 'on' (default), Squid will pass all client If-* headers
#	to the server. This permits server responses without a cacheable
#	payload to be delivered and on MISS no new cache entry is created.
#
#	When set to 'off' and if the request is cacheable, Squid will
#	remove the clients If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match headers from
#	the request sent to the server. This requests a 200 status response
#	from the server to create a new cache entry with.
#Default:
# cache_miss_revalidate on

#  TAG: always_direct
#	Usage: always_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	Here you can use ACL elements to specify requests which should
#	ALWAYS be forwarded by Squid to the origin servers without using
#	any peers.  For example, to always directly forward requests for
#	local servers ignoring any parents or siblings you may have use
#	something like:
#
#		acl local-servers dstdomain my.domain.net
#		always_direct allow local-servers
#
#	To always forward FTP requests directly, use
#
#		acl FTP proto FTP
#		always_direct allow FTP
#
#	NOTE: There is a similar, but opposite option named
#	'never_direct'.  You need to be aware that "always_direct deny
#	foo" is NOT the same thing as "never_direct allow foo".  You
#	may need to use a deny rule to exclude a more-specific case of
#	some other rule.  Example:
#
#		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
#		acl local-servers dstdomain  .foo.net
#		always_direct deny local-external
#		always_direct allow local-servers
#
#	NOTE: If your goal is to make the client forward the request
#	directly to the origin server bypassing Squid then this needs
#	to be done in the client configuration. Squid configuration
#	can only tell Squid how Squid should fetch the object.
#
#	NOTE: This directive is not related to caching. The replies
#	is cached as usual even if you use always_direct. To not cache
#	the replies see the 'cache' directive.
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# Prevent any cache_peer being used for this request.

#  TAG: never_direct
#	Usage: never_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	never_direct is the opposite of always_direct.  Please read
#	the description for always_direct if you have not already.
#
#	With 'never_direct' you can use ACL elements to specify
#	requests which should NEVER be forwarded directly to origin
#	servers.  For example, to force the use of a proxy for all
#	requests, except those in your local domain use something like:
#
#		acl local-servers dstdomain .foo.net
#		never_direct deny local-servers
#		never_direct allow all
#
#	or if Squid is inside a firewall and there are local intranet
#	servers inside the firewall use something like:
#
#		acl local-intranet dstdomain .foo.net
#		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
#		always_direct deny local-external
#		always_direct allow local-intranet
#		never_direct allow all
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# Allow DNS results to be used for this request.

#  TAG: accept_filter
#	FreeBSD:
#
#	The name of an accept(2) filter to install on Squid's
#	listen socket(s).  This feature is perhaps specific to
#	FreeBSD and requires support in the kernel.
#
#	The 'httpready' filter delays delivering new connections
#	to Squid until a full HTTP request has been received.
#	See the accf_http(9) man page for details.
#
#	The 'dataready' filter delays delivering new connections
#	to Squid until there is some data to process.
#	See the accf_dataready(9) man page for details.
#
#	Linux:
#	
#	The 'data' filter delays delivering of new connections
#	to Squid until there is some data to process by TCP_ACCEPT_DEFER.
#	You may optionally specify a number of seconds to wait by
#	'data=N' where N is the number of seconds. Defaults to 30
#	if not specified.  See the tcp(7) man page for details.
#EXAMPLE:
## FreeBSD
#accept_filter httpready
## Linux
#accept_filter data
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: client_ip_max_connections
#	Set an absolute limit on the number of connections a single
#	client IP can use. Any more than this and Squid will begin to drop
#	new connections from the client until it closes some links.
#
#	Note that this is a global limit. It affects all HTTP, HTCP, Gopher and FTP
#	connections from the client. For finer control use the ACL access controls.
#
#	Requires client_db to be enabled (the default).
#
#	WARNING: This may noticably slow down traffic received via external proxies
#	or NAT devices and cause them to rebound error messages back to their clients.
#Default:
# No limit.

#  TAG: tcp_recv_bufsize	(bytes)
#	Size of receive buffer to set for TCP sockets.  Probably just
#	as easy to change your kernel's default.
#	Omit from squid.conf to use the default buffer size.
#Default:
# Use operating system TCP defaults.

# ICAP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: icap_enable	on|off
#	If you want to enable the ICAP module support, set this to on.
#Default:
# icap_enable off

#  TAG: icap_connect_timeout
#	This parameter specifies how long to wait for the TCP connect to
#	the requested ICAP server to complete before giving up and either
#	terminating the HTTP transaction or bypassing the failure.
#
#	The default for optional services is peer_connect_timeout.
#	The default for essential services is connect_timeout.
#	If this option is explicitly set, its value applies to all services.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icap_io_timeout	time-units
#	This parameter specifies how long to wait for an I/O activity on
#	an established, active ICAP connection before giving up and
#	either terminating the HTTP transaction or bypassing the
#	failure.
#Default:
# Use read_timeout.

#  TAG: icap_service_failure_limit	limit [in memory-depth time-units]
#	The limit specifies the number of failures that Squid tolerates
#	when establishing a new TCP connection with an ICAP service. If
#	the number of failures exceeds the limit, the ICAP service is
#	not used for new ICAP requests until it is time to refresh its
#	OPTIONS.
#
#	A negative value disables the limit. Without the limit, an ICAP
#	service will not be considered down due to connectivity failures
#	between ICAP OPTIONS requests.
#
#	Squid forgets ICAP service failures older than the specified
#	value of memory-depth. The memory fading algorithm 
#	is approximate because Squid does not remember individual 
#	errors but groups them instead, splitting the option
#	value into ten time slots of equal length.
#
#	When memory-depth is 0 and by default this option has no 
#	effect on service failure expiration.
#
#	Squid always forgets failures when updating service settings
#	using an ICAP OPTIONS transaction, regardless of this option
#	setting.
#
#	For example,
#		# suspend service usage after 10 failures in 5 seconds:
#		icap_service_failure_limit 10 in 5 seconds
#Default:
# icap_service_failure_limit 10

#  TAG: icap_service_revival_delay
#	The delay specifies the number of seconds to wait after an ICAP
#	OPTIONS request failure before requesting the options again. The
#	failed ICAP service is considered "down" until fresh OPTIONS are
#	fetched.
#
#	The actual delay cannot be smaller than the hardcoded minimum
#	delay of 30 seconds.
#Default:
# icap_service_revival_delay 180

#  TAG: icap_preview_enable	on|off
#	The ICAP Preview feature allows the ICAP server to handle the
#	HTTP message by looking only at the beginning of the message body
#	or even without receiving the body at all. In some environments, 
#	previews greatly speedup ICAP processing.
#
#	During an ICAP OPTIONS transaction, the server may tell	Squid what
#	HTTP messages should be previewed and how big the preview should be.
#	Squid will not use Preview if the server did not request one.
#
#	To disable ICAP Preview for all ICAP services, regardless of
#	individual ICAP server OPTIONS responses, set this option to "off".
#Example:
#icap_preview_enable off
#Default:
# icap_preview_enable on

#  TAG: icap_preview_size
#	The default size of preview data to be sent to the ICAP server.
#	This value might be overwritten on a per server basis by OPTIONS requests.
#Default:
# No preview sent.

#  TAG: icap_206_enable	on|off
#	206 (Partial Content) responses is an ICAP extension that allows the
#	ICAP agents to optionally combine adapted and original HTTP message
#	content. The decision to combine is postponed until the end of the
#	ICAP response. Squid supports Partial Content extension by default.
#
#	Activation of the Partial Content extension is negotiated with each
#	ICAP service during OPTIONS exchange. Most ICAP servers should handle
#	negotation correctly even if they do not support the extension, but
#	some might fail. To disable Partial Content support for all ICAP
#	services and to avoid any negotiation, set this option to "off".
#
#	Example:
#	    icap_206_enable off
#Default:
# icap_206_enable on

#  TAG: icap_default_options_ttl
#	The default TTL value for ICAP OPTIONS responses that don't have
#	an Options-TTL header.
#Default:
# icap_default_options_ttl 60

#  TAG: icap_persistent_connections	on|off
#	Whether or not Squid should use persistent connections to
#	an ICAP server.
#Default:
# icap_persistent_connections on

#  TAG: adaptation_send_client_ip	on|off
#	If enabled, Squid shares HTTP client IP information with adaptation
#	services. For ICAP, Squid adds the X-Client-IP header to ICAP requests.
#	For eCAP, Squid sets the libecap::metaClientIp transaction option.
#
#	See also: adaptation_uses_indirect_client
#Default:
# adaptation_send_client_ip off

#  TAG: adaptation_send_username	on|off
#	This sends authenticated HTTP client username (if available) to
#	the adaptation service.
#
#	For ICAP, the username value is encoded based on the
#	icap_client_username_encode option and is sent using the header
#	specified by the icap_client_username_header option.
#Default:
# adaptation_send_username off

#  TAG: icap_client_username_header
#	ICAP request header name to use for adaptation_send_username.
#Default:
# icap_client_username_header X-Client-Username

#  TAG: icap_client_username_encode	on|off
#	Whether to base64 encode the authenticated client username.
#Default:
# icap_client_username_encode off

#  TAG: icap_service
#	Defines a single ICAP service using the following format:
#
#	icap_service id vectoring_point uri [option ...]
#
#	id: ID
#		an opaque identifier or name which is used to direct traffic to
#		this specific service. Must be unique among all adaptation
#		services in squid.conf.
#
#	vectoring_point: reqmod_precache|reqmod_postcache|respmod_precache|respmod_postcache
#		This specifies at which point of transaction processing the
#		ICAP service should be activated. *_postcache vectoring points
#		are not yet supported.
#
#	uri: icap://servername:port/servicepath
#		ICAP server and service location.
#
#	ICAP does not allow a single service to handle both REQMOD and RESPMOD
#	transactions. Squid does not enforce that requirement. You can specify
#	services with the same service_url and different vectoring_points. You
#	can even specify multiple identical services as long as their
#	service_names differ.
#
#	To activate a service, use the adaptation_access directive. To group
#	services, use adaptation_service_chain and adaptation_service_set.
#
#	Service options are separated by white space. ICAP services support
#	the following name=value options:
#
#	bypass=on|off|1|0
#		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is treated as
#		optional. If the service cannot be reached or malfunctions,
#		Squid will try to ignore any errors and process the message as
#		if the service was not enabled. No all ICAP errors can be
#		bypassed.  If set to 0, the ICAP service is treated as
#		essential and all ICAP errors will result in an error page
#		returned to the HTTP client.
#
#		Bypass is off by default: services are treated as essential.
#
#	routing=on|off|1|0
#		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is allowed to
#		dynamically change the current message adaptation plan by
#		returning a chain of services to be used next. The services
#		are specified using the X-Next-Services ICAP response header
#		value, formatted as a comma-separated list of service names.
#		Each named service should be configured in squid.conf. Other
#		services are ignored. An empty X-Next-Services value results
#		in an empty plan which ends the current adaptation.
#
#		Dynamic adaptation plan may cross or cover multiple supported
#		vectoring points in their natural processing order.
#
#		Routing is not allowed by default: the ICAP X-Next-Services
#		response header is ignored.
#
#	ipv6=on|off
#		Only has effect on split-stack systems. The default on those systems
#		is to use IPv4-only connections. When set to 'on' this option will
#		make Squid use IPv6-only connections to contact this ICAP service.
#
#	on-overload=block|bypass|wait|force
#		If the service Max-Connections limit has been reached, do
#		one of the following for each new ICAP transaction:
#		  * block:  send an HTTP error response to the client
#		  * bypass: ignore the "over-connected" ICAP service
#		  * wait:   wait (in a FIFO queue) for an ICAP connection slot
#		  * force:  proceed, ignoring the Max-Connections limit 
#
#		In SMP mode with N workers, each worker assumes the service
#		connection limit is Max-Connections/N, even though not all
#		workers may use a given service.
#
#		The default value is "bypass" if service is bypassable,
#		otherwise it is set to "wait".
#		
#
#	max-conn=number
#		Use the given number as the Max-Connections limit, regardless
#		of the Max-Connections value given by the service, if any.
#
#	Older icap_service format without optional named parameters is
#	deprecated but supported for backward compatibility.
#
#Example:
#icap_service svcBlocker reqmod_precache icap://icap1.mydomain.net:1344/reqmod bypass=0
#icap_service svcLogger reqmod_precache icap://icap2.mydomain.net:1344/respmod routing=on
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icap_class
#	This deprecated option was documented to define an ICAP service
#	chain, even though it actually defined a set of similar, redundant
#	services, and the chains were not supported. 
#
#	To define a set of redundant services, please use the
#	adaptation_service_set directive. For service chains, use
#	adaptation_service_chain.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icap_access
#	This option is deprecated. Please use adaptation_access, which
#	has the same ICAP functionality, but comes with better
#	documentation, and eCAP support.
#Default:
# none

# eCAP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: ecap_enable	on|off
#	Controls whether eCAP support is enabled.
#Default:
# ecap_enable off

#  TAG: ecap_service
#	Defines a single eCAP service
#
#	ecap_service id vectoring_point uri [option ...]
#
#        id: ID
#		an opaque identifier or name which is used to direct traffic to
#		this specific service. Must be unique among all adaptation
#		services in squid.conf.
#
#	vectoring_point: reqmod_precache|reqmod_postcache|respmod_precache|respmod_postcache
#		This specifies at which point of transaction processing the
#		eCAP service should be activated. *_postcache vectoring points
#		are not yet supported.
#
#	uri: ecap://vendor/service_name?custom&cgi=style&parameters=optional
#		Squid uses the eCAP service URI to match this configuration
#		line with one of the dynamically loaded services. Each loaded
#		eCAP service must have a unique URI. Obtain the right URI from
#		the service provider.
#
#	To activate a service, use the adaptation_access directive. To group
#	services, use adaptation_service_chain and adaptation_service_set.
#
#	Service options are separated by white space. eCAP services support

#	preloaded module(s).
#Example:
#loadable_modules /usr/lib/MinimalAdapter.so
#Default:
# none

# MESSAGE ADAPTATION OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: adaptation_service_set
#
#	Configures an ordered set of similar, redundant services. This is
#	useful when hot standby or backup adaptation servers are available.
#
#	    adaptation_service_set set_name service_name1 service_name2 ...
#
# 	The named services are used in the set declaration order. The first
#	applicable adaptation service from the set is used first. The next
#	applicable service is tried if and only if the transaction with the
#	previous service fails and the message waiting to be adapted is still
#	intact.
#
#	When adaptation starts, broken services are ignored as if they were
#	not a part of the set. A broken service is a down optional service.
#
#	The services in a set must be attached to the same vectoring point
#	(e.g., pre-cache) and use the same adaptation method (e.g., REQMOD).
#
#	If all services in a set are optional then adaptation failures are
#	bypassable. If all services in the set are essential, then a
#	transaction failure with one service may still be retried using
#	another service from the set, but when all services fail, the master
#	transaction fails as well.
#
#	A set may contain a mix of optional and essential services, but that
#	is likely to lead to surprising results because broken services become
#	ignored (see above), making previously bypassable failures fatal.
#	Technically, it is the bypassability of the last failed service that
#	matters.
#
#	See also: adaptation_access adaptation_service_chain
#
#Example:
#adaptation_service_set svcBlocker urlFilterPrimary urlFilterBackup
#adaptation service_set svcLogger loggerLocal loggerRemote
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: adaptation_service_chain
#
#	Configures a list of complementary services that will be applied
#	one-by-one, forming an adaptation chain or pipeline. This is useful
#	when Squid must perform different adaptations on the same message.
#
#	    adaptation_service_chain chain_name service_name1 svc_name2 ...
#
# 	The named services are used in the chain declaration order. The first
#	applicable adaptation service from the chain is used first. The next
#	applicable service is applied to the successful adaptation results of
#	the previous service in the chain.
#
#	When adaptation starts, broken services are ignored as if they were
#	not a part of the chain. A broken service is a down optional service.
#
#	Request satisfaction terminates the adaptation chain because Squid
#	does not currently allow declaration of RESPMOD services at the
#	"reqmod_precache" vectoring point (see icap_service or ecap_service).
#
#	The services in a chain must be attached to the same vectoring point
#	(e.g., pre-cache) and use the same adaptation method (e.g., REQMOD).
#
#	A chain may contain a mix of optional and essential services. If an
#	essential adaptation fails (or the failure cannot be bypassed for
#	other reasons), the master transaction fails. Otherwise, the failure
#	is bypassed as if the failed adaptation service was not in the chain.
#
#	See also: adaptation_access adaptation_service_set
#
#Example:
#adaptation_service_chain svcRequest requestLogger urlFilter leakDetector
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: adaptation_access
#	Sends an HTTP transaction to an ICAP or eCAP adaptation	service.
#
#	adaptation_access service_name allow|deny [!]aclname...
#	adaptation_access set_name     allow|deny [!]aclname...
#
#	At each supported vectoring point, the adaptation_access
#	statements are processed in the order they appear in this
#	configuration file. Statements pointing to the following services
#	are ignored (i.e., skipped without checking their ACL):
#
#	    - services serving different vectoring points
#	    - "broken-but-bypassable" services
#	    - "up" services configured to ignore such transactions
#              (e.g., based on the ICAP Transfer-Ignore header).
#
#        When a set_name is used, all services in the set are checked
#	using the same rules, to find the first applicable one. See
#	adaptation_service_set for details.
#
#	If an access list is checked and there is a match, the
#	processing stops: For an "allow" rule, the corresponding
#	adaptation service is used for the transaction. For a "deny"
#	rule, no adaptation service is activated.
#
#	It is currently not possible to apply more than one adaptation
#	service at the same vectoring point to the same HTTP transaction.
#
#        See also: icap_service and ecap_service
#
#Example:
#adaptation_access service_1 allow all
#Default:
# Allow, unless rules exist in squid.conf.

#  TAG: adaptation_service_iteration_limit
#	Limits the number of iterations allowed when applying adaptation
#	services to a message. If your longest adaptation set or chain
#	may have more than 16 services, increase the limit beyond its
#	default value of 16. If detecting infinite iteration loops sooner
#	is critical, make the iteration limit match the actual number
#	of services in your longest adaptation set or chain.
#
#	Infinite adaptation loops are most likely with routing services.
#
#	See also: icap_service routing=1
#Default:
# adaptation_service_iteration_limit 16

#  TAG: adaptation_masterx_shared_names
#	For each master transaction (i.e., the HTTP request and response
#	sequence, including all related ICAP and eCAP exchanges), Squid
#	maintains a table of metadata. The table entries are (name, value)
#	pairs shared among eCAP and ICAP exchanges. The table is destroyed
#	with the master transaction.
#
#	This option specifies the table entry names that Squid must accept
#	from and forward to the adaptation transactions.
#
#	An ICAP REQMOD or RESPMOD transaction may set an entry in the 
#	shared table by returning an ICAP header field with a name 
#	specified in adaptation_masterx_shared_names.
#
#	An eCAP REQMOD or RESPMOD transaction may set an entry in the
#	shared table by implementing the libecap::visitEachOption() API
#	to provide an option with a name specified in
#	adaptation_masterx_shared_names.
#
#	Squid will store and forward the set entry to subsequent adaptation
#	transactions within the same master transaction scope.
#
#	Only one shared entry name is supported at this time.
#
#Example:
## share authentication information among ICAP services
#adaptation_masterx_shared_names X-Subscriber-ID
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: adaptation_meta
#	This option allows Squid administrator to add custom ICAP request
#	headers or eCAP options to Squid ICAP requests or eCAP transactions.
#	Use it to pass custom authentication tokens and other
#	transaction-state related meta information to an ICAP/eCAP service.
#	
#	The addition of a meta header is ACL-driven:
#		adaptation_meta name value [!]aclname ...
#	
#	Processing for a given header name stops after the first ACL list match.
#	Thus, it is impossible to add two headers with the same name. If no ACL
#	lists match for a given header name, no such header is added. For 
#	example:
#	
#		# do not debug transactions except for those that need debugging
#		adaptation_meta X-Debug 1 needs_debugging
#	
#		# log all transactions except for those that must remain secret
#		adaptation_meta X-Log 1 !keep_secret
#	
#		# mark transactions from users in the "G 1" group
#		adaptation_meta X-Authenticated-Groups "G 1" authed_as_G1
#	
#	The "value" parameter may be a regular squid.conf token or a "double
#	quoted string". Within the quoted string, use backslash (\) to escape
#	any character, which is currently only useful for escaping backslashes
#	and double quotes. For example,
#	    "this string has one backslash (\\) and two \"quotes\""
#
#	Used adaptation_meta header values may be logged via %note
#	logformat code. If multiple adaptation_meta headers with the same name
#	are used during master transaction lifetime, the header values are
#	logged in the order they were used and duplicate values are ignored
#	(only the first repeated value will be logged).
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icap_retry
#	This ACL determines which retriable ICAP transactions are
#	retried. Transactions that received a complete ICAP response
#	and did not have to consume or produce HTTP bodies to receive
#	that response are usually retriable.
#
#	icap_retry allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	Squid automatically retries some ICAP I/O timeouts and errors
#	due to persistent connection race conditions.
#
#	See also: icap_retry_limit
#Default:
# icap_retry deny all

#  TAG: icap_retry_limit
#	Limits the number of retries allowed.
#
#	Communication errors due to persistent connection race
#	conditions are unavoidable, automatically retried, and do not
#	count against this limit.
#
#	See also: icap_retry
#Default:
# No retries are allowed.

# DNS OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: check_hostnames
#	For security and stability reasons Squid can check
#	hostnames for Internet standard RFC compliance. If you want
#	Squid to perform these checks turn this directive on.
#Default:
# check_hostnames off

#  TAG: allow_underscore
#	Underscore characters is not strictly allowed in Internet hostnames
#	but nevertheless used by many sites. Set this to off if you want
#	Squid to be strict about the standard.
#	This check is performed only when check_hostnames is set to on.
#Default:
# allow_underscore on

#  TAG: cache_dns_program
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --disable-internal-dns
#
#	Specify the location of the executable for dnslookup process.
#Default:
# cache_dns_program /usr/lib/squid3/dnsserver

#  TAG: dns_children
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --disable-internal-dns
#
#	The maximum number of processes spawn to service DNS name lookups.
#	If you limit it too few Squid will have to wait for them to process
#	a backlog of requests, slowing it down. If you allow too many they
#	will use RAM and other system resources noticably.
#	The maximum this may be safely set to is 32.
#	
#	The startup= and idle= options allow some measure of skew in your
#	tuning.
#	
#		startup=
#	
#	Sets a minimum of how many processes are to be spawned when Squid
#	starts or reconfigures. When set to zero the first request will
#	cause spawning of the first child process to handle it.
#	
#	Starting too few will cause an initial slowdown in traffic as Squid
#	attempts to simultaneously spawn enough processes to cope.
#	
#		idle=
#	
#	Sets a minimum of how many processes Squid is to try and keep available
#	at all times. When traffic begins to rise above what the existing
#	processes can handle this many more will be spawned up to the maximum
#	configured. A minimum setting of 1 is required.
#Default:
# dns_children 32 startup=1 idle=1

#  TAG: dns_retransmit_interval
#	Initial retransmit interval for DNS queries. The interval is
#	doubled each time all configured DNS servers have been tried.
#Default:
# dns_retransmit_interval 5 seconds

#  TAG: dns_timeout
#	DNS Query timeout. If no response is received to a DNS query
#	within this time all DNS servers for the queried domain
#	are assumed to be unavailable.
#Default:
# dns_timeout 30 seconds

#  TAG: dns_packet_max
#	Maximum number of bytes packet size to advertise via EDNS.
#	Set to "none" to disable EDNS large packet support.
#	
#	For legacy reasons DNS UDP replies will default to 512 bytes which
#	is too small for many responses. EDNS provides a means for Squid to
#	negotiate receiving larger responses back immediately without having
#	to failover with repeat requests. Responses larger than this limit
#	will retain the old behaviour of failover to TCP DNS.
#	
#	Squid has no real fixed limit internally, but allowing packet sizes
#	over 1500 bytes requires network jumbogram support and is usually not
#	necessary.
#	
#	WARNING: The RFC also indicates that some older resolvers will reply
#	with failure of the whole request if the extension is added. Some
#	resolvers have already been identified which will reply with mangled
#	EDNS response on occasion. Usually in response to many-KB jumbogram
#	sizes being advertised by Squid.
#	Squid will currently treat these both as an unable-to-resolve domain
#	even if it would be resolvable without EDNS.
#Default:
# EDNS disabled

#  TAG: dns_defnames	on|off
#	Normally the RES_DEFNAMES resolver option is disabled
#	(see res_init(3)).  This prevents caches in a hierarchy
#	from interpreting single-component hostnames locally.  To allow
#	Squid to handle single-component names, enable this option.
#Default:
# Search for single-label domain names is disabled.

#  TAG: dns_multicast_local	on|off
#	When set to on, Squid sends multicast DNS lookups on the local
#	network for domains ending in .local and .arpa.
#	This enables local servers and devices to be contacted in an
#	ad-hoc or zero-configuration network environment.
#Default:
# Search for .local and .arpa names is disabled.

#  TAG: dns_nameservers
#	Use this if you want to specify a list of DNS name servers
#	(IP addresses) to use instead of those given in your
#	/etc/resolv.conf file.
#
#	On Windows platforms, if no value is specified here or in
#	the /etc/resolv.conf file, the list of DNS name servers are
#	taken from the Windows registry, both static and dynamic DHCP
#	configurations are supported.
#
#	Example: dns_nameservers 10.0.0.1 192.172.0.4
#Default:
# Use operating system definitions

#  TAG: hosts_file
#	Location of the host-local IP name-address associations
#	database. Most Operating Systems have such a file on different
#	default locations:
#	- Un*X & Linux:    /etc/hosts
#	- Windows NT/2000: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
#			   (%SystemRoot% value install default is c:\winnt)
#	- Windows XP/2003: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
#			   (%SystemRoot% value install default is c:\windows)
#	- Windows 9x/Me:   %windir%\hosts
#			   (%windir% value is usually c:\windows)
#	- Cygwin:	   /etc/hosts
#
#	The file contains newline-separated definitions, in the
#	form ip_address_in_dotted_form name [name ...] names are
#	whitespace-separated. Lines beginning with an hash (#)
#	character are comments.
#
#	The file is checked at startup and upon configuration.
#	If set to 'none', it won't be checked.
#	If append_domain is used, that domain will be added to
#	domain-local (i.e. not containing any dot character) host
#	definitions.
#Default:
hosts_file /etc/squid_hosts

#  TAG: append_domain
#	Appends local domain name to hostnames without any dots in
#	them.  append_domain must begin with a period.
#
#	Be warned there are now Internet names with no dots in
#	them using only top-domain names, so setting this may
#	cause some Internet sites to become unavailable.
#
#Example:
# append_domain .yourdomain.com
#Default:
# Use operating system definitions

#  TAG: ignore_unknown_nameservers
#	By default Squid checks that DNS responses are received
#	from the same IP addresses they are sent to.  If they
#	don't match, Squid ignores the response and writes a warning
#	message to cache.log.  You can allow responses from unknown
#	nameservers by setting this option to 'off'.
#Default:
# ignore_unknown_nameservers on

#  TAG: dns_v4_first
#	With the IPv6 Internet being as fast or faster than IPv4 Internet
#	for most networks Squid prefers to contact websites over IPv6.
#
#	This option reverses the order of preference to make Squid contact
#	dual-stack websites over IPv4 first. Squid will still perform both
#	IPv6 and IPv4 DNS lookups before connecting.
#
#	WARNING:
#	  This option will restrict the situations under which IPv6
#	  connectivity is used (and tested), potentially hiding network
#	  problems which would otherwise be detected and warned about.
#Default:
# dns_v4_first off

#  TAG: ipcache_size	(number of entries)
#	Maximum number of DNS IP cache entries.
#Default:
# ipcache_size 1024

#  TAG: ipcache_low	(percent)
#Default:
# ipcache_low 90

#  TAG: ipcache_high	(percent)
#	The size, low-, and high-water marks for the IP cache.
#Default:
# ipcache_high 95

#  TAG: fqdncache_size	(number of entries)
#	Maximum number of FQDN cache entries.
#Default:
# fqdncache_size 1024

# MISCELLANEOUS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: configuration_includes_quoted_values	on|off
#	Previous Squid versions have defined "quoted/string" as syntax for
#	ACL to signifiy the value is an included file containing values and
#	has treated the " characters in other places of the configuration file
#	as part of the parameter value it was used for.
#
#	For compatibility with existing installations that behaviour
#	remains the default.
#
#	If this directive is set to 'on', Squid will start parsing each
#	"quoted string" as a single configuration directive parameter. The
#	quotes are stripped before the parameter value is interpreted or use.
#
#	That will continue for all lines until this directive is set to 'off',
#	where Squid will return to the default configuration parsing.
#
#	For example;
#
#		configuration_includes_quoted_values on
#		acl group external groupCheck Administrators "Internet Users" Guest
#		configuration_includes_quoted_values off
#
#Default:
# configuration_includes_quoted_values off

#  TAG: memory_pools	on|off
#	If set, Squid will keep pools of allocated (but unused) memory
#	available for future use.  If memory is a premium on your
#	system and you believe your malloc library outperforms Squid
#	routines, disable this.
#Default:
# memory_pools on

#  TAG: memory_pools_limit	(bytes)
#	Used only with memory_pools on:
#	memory_pools_limit 50 MB
#
#	If set to a non-zero value, Squid will keep at most the specified
#	limit of allocated (but unused) memory in memory pools. All free()
#	requests that exceed this limit will be handled by your malloc
#	library. Squid does not pre-allocate any memory, just safe-keeps
#	objects that otherwise would be free()d. Thus, it is safe to set
#	memory_pools_limit to a reasonably high value even if your
#	configuration will use less memory.
#
#	If set to none, Squid will keep all memory it can. That is, there
#	will be no limit on the total amount of memory used for safe-keeping.
#
#	To disable memory allocation optimization, do not set
#	memory_pools_limit to 0 or none. Set memory_pools to "off" instead.
#
#	An overhead for maintaining memory pools is not taken into account
#	when the limit is checked. This overhead is close to four bytes per
#	object kept. However, pools may actually _save_ memory because of
#	reduced memory thrashing in your malloc library.
#Default:
# memory_pools_limit 5 MB

#  TAG: forwarded_for	on|off|transparent|truncate|delete
#	If set to "on", Squid will append your client's IP address
#	in the HTTP requests it forwards. By default it looks like:
#
#		X-Forwarded-For: 192.1.2.3
#
#	If set to "off", it will appear as
#
#		X-Forwarded-For: unknown
#
#	If set to "transparent", Squid will not alter the
#	X-Forwarded-For header in any way.
#
#	If set to "delete", Squid will delete the entire
#	X-Forwarded-For header.
#
#	If set to "truncate", Squid will remove all existing
#	X-Forwarded-For entries, and place the client IP as the sole entry.
#Default:
# forwarded_for on

#  TAG: cachemgr_passwd
#	Specify passwords for cachemgr operations.
#
#	Usage: cachemgr_passwd password action action ...
#
#	Some valid actions are (see cache manager menu for a full list):
#		5min
#		60min
#		asndb
#		authenticator
#		cbdata
#		client_list
#		comm_incoming
#		config *
#		counters
#		delay
#		digest_stats
#		dns
#		events
#		filedescriptors
#		fqdncache
#		histograms
#		http_headers
#		info
#		io
#		ipcache
#		mem
#		menu
#		netdb
#		non_peers
#		objects
#		offline_toggle *
#		pconn
#		peer_select
#		reconfigure *
#		redirector
#		refresh
#		server_list
#		shutdown *
#		store_digest
#		storedir
#		utilization
#		via_headers
#		vm_objects
#
#	* Indicates actions which will not be performed without a
#	  valid password, others can be performed if not listed here.
#
#	To disable an action, set the password to "disable".
#	To allow performing an action without a password, set the
#	password to "none".
#
#	Use the keyword "all" to set the same password for all actions.
#
#Example:
# cachemgr_passwd secret shutdown
# cachemgr_passwd lesssssssecret info stats/objects
# cachemgr_passwd disable all
#Default:
# No password. Actions which require password are denied.

#  TAG: client_db	on|off
#	If you want to disable collecting per-client statistics,
#	turn off client_db here.
#Default:
# client_db on

#  TAG: refresh_all_ims	on|off
#	When you enable this option, squid will always check
#	the origin server for an update when a client sends an
#	If-Modified-Since request.  Many browsers use IMS
#	requests when the user requests a reload, and this
#	ensures those clients receive the latest version.
#
#	By default (off), squid may return a Not Modified response
#	based on the age of the cached version.
#Default:
# refresh_all_ims off

#  TAG: reload_into_ims	on|off
#	When you enable this option, client no-cache or ``reload''
#	requests will be changed to If-Modified-Since requests.
#	Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling this
#	feature could make you liable for problems which it
#	causes.
#
#	see also refresh_pattern for a more selective approach.
#Default:
# reload_into_ims off

#  TAG: connect_retries
#	This sets the maximum number of connection attempts made for each
#	TCP connection. The connect_retries attempts must all still
#	complete within the connection timeout period.
#
#	The default is not to re-try if the first connection attempt fails.
#	The (not recommended) maximum is 10 tries.
#
#	A warning message will be generated if it is set to a too-high
#	value and the configured value will be over-ridden.
#
#	Note: These re-tries are in addition to forward_max_tries
#	which limit how many different addresses may be tried to find
#	a useful server.
#Default:
# Do not retry failed connections.

#  TAG: retry_on_error
#	If set to ON Squid will automatically retry requests when
#	receiving an error response with status 403 (Forbidden),
#	500 (Internal Error), 501 or 503 (Service not available).
#	Status 502 and 504 (Gateway errors) are always retried.
#	
#	This is mainly useful if you are in a complex cache hierarchy to
#	work around access control errors.
#	
#	NOTE: This retry will attempt to find another working destination.
#	Which is different from the server which just failed.
#Default:
# retry_on_error off

#  TAG: as_whois_server
#	WHOIS server to query for AS numbers.  NOTE: AS numbers are
#	queried only when Squid starts up, not for every request.
#Default:
# as_whois_server whois.ra.net

#  TAG: offline_mode
#	Enable this option and Squid will never try to validate cached
#	objects.
#Default:
# offline_mode off

#  TAG: uri_whitespace
#	What to do with requests that have whitespace characters in the
#	URI.  Options:
#
#	strip:  The whitespace characters are stripped out of the URL.
#		This is the behavior recommended by RFC2396 and RFC3986
#		for tolerant handling of generic URI.
#		NOTE: This is one difference between generic URI and HTTP URLs.
#
#	deny:   The request is denied.  The user receives an "Invalid
#		Request" message.
#		This is the behaviour recommended by RFC2616 for safe
#		handling of HTTP request URL.
#
#	allow:  The request is allowed and the URI is not changed.  The
#		whitespace characters remain in the URI.  Note the
#		whitespace is passed to redirector processes if they
#		are in use.
#		Note this may be considered a violation of RFC2616
#		request parsing where whitespace is prohibited in the
#		URL field.
#
#	encode:	The request is allowed and the whitespace characters are
#		encoded according to RFC1738.
#
#	chop:	The request is allowed and the URI is chopped at the
#		first whitespace.
#
#
#	NOTE the current Squid implementation of encode and chop violates
#	RFC2616 by not using a 301 redirect after altering the URL.
#Default:
# uri_whitespace strip

#  TAG: chroot
#	Specifies a directory where Squid should do a chroot() while
#	initializing.  This also causes Squid to fully drop root
#	privileges after initializing.  This means, for example, if you
#	use a HTTP port less than 1024 and try to reconfigure, you may
#	get an error saying that Squid can not open the port.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: balance_on_multiple_ip
#	Modern IP resolvers in squid sort lookup results by preferred access.
#	By default squid will use these IP in order and only rotates to
#	the next listed when the most preffered fails.
#
#	Some load balancing servers based on round robin DNS have been
#	found not to preserve user session state across requests
#	to different IP addresses.
#
#	Enabling this directive Squid rotates IP's per request.
#Default:
# balance_on_multiple_ip off

#  TAG: pipeline_prefetch
#	HTTP clients may send a pipeline of 1+N requests to Squid using a
#	single connection, without waiting for Squid to respond to the first
#	of those requests. This option limits the number of concurrent
#	requests Squid will try to handle in parallel. If set to N, Squid
#	will try to receive and process up to 1+N requests on the same
#	connection concurrently.
#
#	Defaults to 0 (off) for bandwidth management and access logging
#	reasons.
#
#	NOTE: pipelining requires persistent connections to clients.
#
#	WARNING: pipelining breaks NTLM and Negotiate/Kerberos authentication.
#Default:
# Do not pre-parse pipelined requests.

#  TAG: high_response_time_warning	(msec)
#	If the one-minute median response time exceeds this value,
#	Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get the
#	administrators attention.  The value is in milliseconds.
#Default:
# disabled.

#  TAG: high_page_fault_warning
#	If the one-minute average page fault rate exceeds this
#	value, Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get
#	the administrators attention.  The value is in page faults
#	per second.
#Default:
# disabled.

#  TAG: high_memory_warning
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       GNU Malloc with mstats()
#
#	If the memory usage (as determined by mallinfo) exceeds
#	this amount, Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get
#	the administrators attention.
#Default:
# disabled.

#  TAG: sleep_after_fork	(microseconds)
#	When this is set to a non-zero value, the main Squid process
#	sleeps the specified number of microseconds after a fork()
#	system call. This sleep may help the situation where your
#	system reports fork() failures due to lack of (virtual)
#	memory. Note, however, if you have a lot of child
#	processes, these sleep delays will add up and your
#	Squid will not service requests for some amount of time
#	until all the child processes have been started.
#	On Windows value less then 1000 (1 milliseconds) are
#	rounded to 1000.
#Default:
# sleep_after_fork 0

#  TAG: windows_ipaddrchangemonitor	on|off
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       MS Windows
#
#	On Windows Squid by default will monitor IP address changes and will 
#	reconfigure itself after any detected event. This is very useful for
#	proxies connected to internet with dial-up interfaces.
#	In some cases (a Proxy server acting as VPN gateway is one) it could be
#	desiderable to disable this behaviour setting this to 'off'.
#	Note: after changing this, Squid service must be restarted.
#Default:
# windows_ipaddrchangemonitor on

#  TAG: eui_lookup
#	Whether to lookup the EUI or MAC address of a connected client.
#Default:
# eui_lookup on

#  TAG: max_filedescriptors
#	Reduce the maximum number of filedescriptors supported below
#	the usual operating system defaults.
#
#	Remove from squid.conf to inherit the current ulimit setting.
#
#	Note: Changing this requires a restart of Squid. Also
#	not all I/O types supports large values (eg on Windows).
#Default:
# Use operating system limits set by ulimit.

#  TAG: workers
#	Number of main Squid processes or "workers" to fork and maintain.
#	0: "no daemon" mode, like running "squid -N ..."
#	1: "no SMP" mode, start one main Squid process daemon (default)
#	N: start N main Squid process daemons (i.e., SMP mode)
#
#	In SMP mode, each worker does nearly all what a single Squid daemon
#	does (e.g., listen on http_port and forward HTTP requests).
#Default:
# SMP support disabled.

#  TAG: cpu_affinity_map
#	Usage: cpu_affinity_map process_numbers=P1,P2,... cores=C1,C2,...
#
#	Sets 1:1 mapping between Squid processes and CPU cores. For example,
#
#	    cpu_affinity_map process_numbers=1,2,3,4 cores=1,3,5,7
#
#	affects processes 1 through 4 only and places them on the first
#	four even cores, starting with core #1.
#
#	CPU cores are numbered starting from 1. Requires support for
#	sched_getaffinity(2) and sched_setaffinity(2) system calls.
#
#	Multiple cpu_affinity_map options are merged.
#
#	See also: workers
#Default:
# Let operating system decide.
